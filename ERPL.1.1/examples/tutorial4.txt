[Besides simple numbers and texts, you can make lists that combine many of the same thing.]

Let Primes be 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 17.
Write item 1 of the Primes.

[Oops, we missed a number!]

Let item 6 of the Primes be 13.
Append 17 to the Primes.
Write the Primes.

[Primes is a list of numbers. Get specific items of a list by giving the item's number in the list.]
[You can also do things to every item of the list at once, using the word 'each'.]

Write each item of the Primes.

[Another use of the word 'each' might be to combine all of the items together somehow.]

Let N be 1.
Multiply N by each item of the Primes.
Write N.

[Trying to access an item of the list that doesn't exist will produce an error.]
[There are several good ways of avoiding this.]

Let I be a number.
Write "Enter an item of the list...".
Read I.
If I is greater than the range of the Primes, write "Bad input, caught you!".
If item I of the Primes exists, write item I of the Primes.
