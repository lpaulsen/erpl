[Tables in ERPL work like lists, but they are accessed using text instead of numbers.]
[Accessing tables works almost exactly like lists; just use 'entry' instead of 'item'.]

Let Scrabble be a table of numbers.
Let entry "a" of Scrabble be 1.
Let entry "z" of Scrabble be 10.
Write Scrabble.

[Double word score!]

Multiply each entry of Scrabble by 2.
Write Scrabble.

[What if we want to do something more complicated to each entry? What if we want to use the names?]
[We can use 'label' to access the names, and do our more complicated work using 'for'.]
['For' works somewhat like while, except that it happens once for 'each' item or entry it's given.]

For each label L in Scrabble:
    Let the Value be the contents of entry L of Scrabble.
    Write "The value of " followed by L followed by " is " followed by the Value.
